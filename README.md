# learn to find CVE
do you want to learn about CVE?, This is the right place to learn CVE

what is cve, cve or called Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a system that provides methods about information security vulnerabilities and exposures that are known to everyone. every vulnerability found will be a report which will later be used as documentation. CVE consists of Year and Alphanumeric Id (CVE-Year-ID). The meaning of the brackets beside is CVE - Year found - ID This is the number assigned to a security flaw or vulnerability.

CVE is generally stored and reused by other people later, people usually do a penetration test on a website and report mandatory use of CVE.

Requirements that must meet the CVE:
1. Repairable
2. Verify through other documentation as a negative impact on security
3. Relevant to one code base, so each newly discovered vulnerability only has 1 code base (ID).

CVE has a general level of vulnerability assessment, this is the standard CVE value which will later become a score. in the general vulnerability assessment system it can be seen how severe the vulnerabilities found are,

Example: you found a vulnerability that could have other people's access rights.

from this example that the vulnerability is very severe because he has access rights and moreover can remote access to other users. there are still interesting notes from me, thank you, hopefully they will be educational material.

Thank You.
